# React RxJS Todos

This repo shows a basic todos example base on the famous [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) but using RxJS and React. The goal is to show how to use the Observables data architecture pattern within React. The implementation was inspired by the [React Rx TodoMVC Example](https://github.com/fdecampredon/react-rxjs-todomvc).
